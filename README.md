## What I learnt in the first javascript class

1. Variable Declaration or Initialisation : This simply means creating a space on our computer memory by the use of var,let and const., on a variable( Let x ; ) i.e i this case, we just created a memory for x without assigning anything to it.

2. Variable Assignment : This can only be done with the use of the **assignment operator**(=) , to assign variables to an operant or declared variable( x=8 ).

3. Variable Call : Like the name implies, this simply means calling an assigned variable, let's say we have two already assigned variables x=8 and y=6 then ( Let z = x+y ) simply means z=8+6 since we have already created a memory for x and y.

### **HOW TO DECLARE VARIABLES**

1. Automatically

2. Using **Var:** this is a function scope because it works inside a function block.

3. Using **Let:** this permits reassignment ( Let x ; , x=14 , x=58).

4. Using **Const:** this is used for values that won't be changed because const doesn't allow reassignment. Const doesn't allow you to declare alone, you must assign while declaring a variable using const. ( Const x = 45 ; i.e declaration and assignment). 

### **Data Types**

1. **Strings** : This is when a group of letters,numbers,symbols, etc are being placed inside a quotation (Const myName = "Marvelous" ;) Marvelous is being put in a quotation which makes it a string. It can be symbols and numbers (Const myName = "23487$#@#$$" ;)

2. **Numbers** : This is when the digit or numbers are not inside a quotation (Const myNumber = 8147766088 ; )

## **BEST PRACTICES**

### DO'S on How to call Variable names 

1. You can use **Pascal Case** (MentorName) : The first letters of each word should start with an uppercase letter.

2. You can use **Camel case** (myName) : The first word starts with a lowercase letter while the other words starts with an uppercase letter.

3. You can use **Small case** (myname) : The words are all written in lowercase letters.

4. You can use **Snake case** (my_Name) : This is using an underscore( _ ) between words.

### DON'TS on How to call Variable names 

1. Do not start a variable name with numbers : (24mentorName).

2. Do not use dash to a vairable name : (mentor-name or -mentorName).

3. Do not add space to a variable name : (Mentor Name).

**N.B** : I also learnt that we can use **Console.log** to check our data type. {Console.log (typeof mentorName, typeof mentorNumber)}.
